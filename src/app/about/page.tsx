            Hey there! I&apos;m <span className="italic dark:text-blue-500 text-blue-900">Kevin Thumbar ðŸ’™</span>, but you can just call me
            Kevin like everyone else does. I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer and Freelancer ðŸš€ with a passion for building and shipping cool stuff. Fun fact: I got hooked on computer science and mathematics, and that fascination led me into the exciting world of web development. Now, I&apos;m knee-deep in creating and loving every minute of it.

            I mainly work with React and Next.js for both frontend and backend, using TypeScript. I also have experience working with Node.js and AWS Cloud Services to build and deploy scalable, robust applications. Besides that, I love learning new things every dayâ€”gotta keep that curiosity alive! I&apos;m also on the lookout for opportunities in this field, so if you&apos;ve got something for me, shoot me a DM on Twitter. I&apos;m super active there.
